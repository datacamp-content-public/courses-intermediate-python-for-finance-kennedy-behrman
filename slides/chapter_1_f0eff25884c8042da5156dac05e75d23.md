`@script`
You have already seen how to create DataFrames, and how to access the data they contain. Now let's look at extending and manipulating DataFrames.

---

## Adding and Removing Columns

```yaml
type: FullSlide
key: a09ad2ab9e
```

`@part1`
Create a DataFrame
```
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
df = pd.DataFrame(np.random.randint(0, 50, size=[10,4]), columns = ['Q1','Q2','Q3','Q4'])
df
```



`@script`
First let's create a DataFrame populated with random numbers. For this we use numpy's random integer generation capabilities.

## Adding and Removing Columns

```yaml
type: FullSlide
key: 83f547dbd2
```

`@part1`
A new columns from outside data
```
df['K'] = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g','h', 'i', 'j']
df
```

`@script`
You can add a new column by just assigning data to it.

## Adding and Removing Columns

```yaml
type: FullSlide
key: 72ae1385b3
```

`@part1`
A new columns from outside data
```
df['K'] = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g','h', 'i', 'j']
df
```

A new column based on an operation across existing ones
```
df['âˆ†'] = df['Q4'] - df['Q3']
df
```

`@script`
You can create a new column by using manipulating data from existing columns. You will find this often comes up as you analyze the relationship between columns.

---

## Adding and Removing Columns

```yaml
type: FullSlide
key: 580eb278ae
```

`@part1`
Drop Method
```
df.drop(columns=['K'])
```

`@script`
To remove a column, use the drop method. Note that this method returns a new DataFrame, it does not change the original one in place.

---

## Map method

```yaml
type: FullSlide
key: d97e307411
```

`@part1`
```
def update_convention(x):
    return f"{x}-cd"
    
    
df['K'] = df['K'].map(update_convention)
df
```

`@script`


---

## Apply

```yaml
type: FullSlide
key: d9f0dd43ef
```

`@part1`


`@script`
Applies a function alone an axis of a DataFrame. This can be either a column or row.

## Let's practice!

```yaml
type: FinalSlide
key: e5ba3b5404
```
